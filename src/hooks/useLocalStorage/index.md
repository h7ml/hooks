description: The useLocalStorage hook is a custom React hook that manages a single localStorage key and synchronizes its value with the component's state. It provides an array containing the current value of the localStorage key and a function to update its value. This hook is useful for storing and retrieving data from the localStorage in a React component, ensuring that the component state and the localStorage value stay in sync.
