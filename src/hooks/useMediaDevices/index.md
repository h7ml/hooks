description: The useMediaDevices hook is a custom React hook that allows you to get information about connected media devices, such as cameras and microphones. It returns an array of MediaDeviceInfo objects, each containing the deviceId, kind, and label of the connected media device. This hook is useful for applications that require access to media devices and want to provide users with information about available devices.
