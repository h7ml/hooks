description: The useNetwork hook is a custom React hook that allows you to get information about the network connection status. It returns an object with online and type properties. The online property is a boolean indicating whether the device is connected to the internet, and the type property provides information about the network connection type. This hook is useful for applications that need to react to changes in the network connection status or display network-related information to users.
