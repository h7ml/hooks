title: useSessionStorage
description: The useSessionStorage hook is a custom React hook that manages a single sessionStorage key and synchronizes its value with the component's state. It provides an array containing the current value of the sessionStorage key and a function to update its value. This hook is useful for storing and retrieving data from the sessionStorage in a React component, ensuring that the component state and the sessionStorage value stay in sync within the same session.
