title: useFileDownloader
description: useFileDownloader is a custom React Hook designed to enable file downloads within React components. It allows users to trigger file downloads by providing a file URL and an optional filename. The hook utilizes the fetch API to fetch the file from the given URL and initiates the download using an anchor (a) element without the need for streamsaver or CORS proxies. This hook offers a convenient way to implement file downloads in React components.
