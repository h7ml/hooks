title: useSafeState
description: The useSafeState hook is a utility function in React that helps ensure safe state updates, even when a component is unmounted. It acts as an enhancement to the useState hook by checking if the component is still mounted before updating the state. This helps prevent potential memory leaks or errors caused by state updates in unmounted components.
